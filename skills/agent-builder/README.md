# agent-builder

A comprehensive, modular skill for designing, evaluating, and improving agentic harnesses — the layer around the model that turns a language model into a product.

**Two bodies of knowledge, one skill:**

- **Methodology** — *how to decide*. Principles, shapes, tools, state, context, extensibility, UX, design playbook, evaluation playbook, output patterns, and cross-client portability notes. 11 topic files.
- **Catalog** — *what exists*. Architecture taxonomy (Type I–V), six-component harness model, 7 framework deep dives (LangGraph / CrewAI / Pydantic AI / smolagents / DSPy / AutoGen / Bedrock), memory substrate inventory, 14 production lab patterns (Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity, Manus, Google, Devin, Cursor, Windsurf, and more), and dedicated guidance for agents built on local/open-source models (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral). 6 catalog files.

Plus output templates, two fully worked examples, and host-specific variants (Anthropic, Codex) with their own auto-activation metadata.

## When it activates

Automatic triggers include requests to design or rebuild an agent/assistant/copilot, evaluate an existing harness, compare frameworks, pick a memory substrate, or diagnose symptoms like stale context, surprising tool calls, brittle sessions, missing approval controls, or costs drifting out of control. See the `description` field in `SKILL.md` for the full trigger list.

## Modes

1. `design` — new harness or major rebuild
2. `evaluation` — existing harness needs findings + upgrade path
3. `design + evaluation` — target architecture plus acceptance criteria
4. `catalog-lookup` — factual questions about what frameworks / substrates / patterns exist

### Host variants

The root `SKILL.md` is host-agnostic and works on any Claude Code skill host. Two optimized variants are available:

- **`variants/anthropic/SKILL.md`** — uses the natural-language description format Anthropic hosts prefer for auto-activation. Use this if you're deploying on Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or the Claude API.
- **`variants/codex/SKILL.md`** — includes the `metadata:` frontmatter block with `pathPatterns`, `importPatterns`, `bashPatterns`, and `promptSignals` (scoring system with `minScore: 6`) that Codex-style hosts use to decide when to auto-activate a skill. Use this if you're deploying on Codex or any host that honors the same metadata schema.

To activate a variant as the default, replace the root `SKILL.md` with the variant file. All reference paths in the variants assume they're copied to the skill root.

## Install

**As a Claude Code plugin via the RossLabs marketplace:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add tyroneross/RossLabs-AI-Toolkit
/plugin install agent-builder@RossLabs-AI-Toolkit
```

**As a standalone user skill** (any plugin host or bare Claude Code):
```bash
cp -R skills/agent-builder ~/.claude/skills/agent-builder
```

**Inside another plugin:** drop `agent-builder/` into that plugin's `skills/` directory and it becomes available wherever the host plugin is installed.

## Design posture

The skill defaults to lean, solo-maintainable, single-agent architecture and requires empirical evidence (not vibes) before escalating to multi-agent. The catalog's verified stats — multi-agent costs 15× chat tokens, 70%+ of multi-agent failures are systemic, only 11% of orgs run production agents — are the anchor. When you push for complexity, the skill will ask for the constraint that justifies it.
